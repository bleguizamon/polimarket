# polimarket

This application was generated using openjdk 17.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
./mvnw
./npmw start
```

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the polimarket application for production, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify
```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify
```

### Docker Compose support

JHipster generates a number of Docker Compose configuration files in the [src/main/docker/](src/main/docker/) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start required services in Docker containers, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/services.yml up -d
```

To stop and remove the containers, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/services.yml down
```

[Spring Docker Compose Integration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/dev-services.html) is enabled by default. It's possible to disable it in application.yml:

```yaml
spring:
  ...
  docker:
    compose:
      enabled: false
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a Docker image of your app by running:

```sh
npm run java:docker
```

Or build a arm64 Docker image when using an arm64 processor os like MacOS with M1 processor family running:

```sh
npm run java:docker:arm64
```

Then run:

```sh
docker compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```
